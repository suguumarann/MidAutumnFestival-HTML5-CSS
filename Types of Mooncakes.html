                            Su mooncakes appeared more than a thousand years ago. 
                            <br><br>They are well known throughout China for their layers of flaky pastry and generous use of sugar and lard.

                            <br><br>The skin of the mooncakes is not made of snow. 
                            They got this name because their skins are often white or made of pale colors and are not baked in an oven, but stored in a refrigerator instead.<br><br>
                            The crust is made of frozen glutinous rice, and looks snow white. Now some people add juice to the crust to make it look more colorful. 
                            <br><br>The fillings can be sweet or savory, or both, such as fruit and duck egg yolks. It tastes more wonderful chilled.<br><br>
