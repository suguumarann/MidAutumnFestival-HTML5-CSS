                <h3>The most prominent legend of the Mid-Autumn Festival regards Chang'e, the Chinese Moon Goddess,</h3>

                    Long, long ago, there were 10 suns in the sky. The suns burnt all the land on Earth and brought death to humans. <br><br>One day, an archer, Hou Yi used his bow and arrows and shoot down nine of the suns and all the people on Earth were
                    saved.

                    <br>The Queen of the West, gave Hou Yi a bottle of elixir that could make him immortal. The elixer can only be used by one individual. <br><br>Although Hou Yi did want to become immortal, he wanted to be together with Chang'e, his wife,
                    more.<br> So, he ended up not drink the elixir and asked Chang'e to keep it safe for him instead.

                    <br><h3 class="sub_header em shadow">Chang'e Flying to the Moon</h3><br><br>

                    Hou Yi became very famous after he shot down the nine suns. People wanted him to be their
                    master and most of them were accepted by Hou Yi. 
                    
                    <br><br>However, not every student who was under Hou Yi had good intentions. Pang
                    Meng, was one such student. He had the intention of stealing Hou Yi's elixer of immortality.

                    <br><br>One day, when Hou Yi went hunting with his students, but Pang Meng pretended to be ill and stayed
                    at home. After making sure Hou Yi had left for the forests with his students, he went to Hou Yi's home and tried to force Chang'e to give
                    him the elixir. <br><br>Chang'e sticken with fear, knowing that she wouldn't be able to defend herself against Pang Meng, drank the elixir immediately in panic because she didn't want the elixer to fall into the wrong hands. 
                    <br><br>Drinking the elixer made Chang'e fly higher and higher to the point where she landed on the moon. <br>Chang'e had become immortal.

                    <br><h3 class="sub_header em shadow">Hou Yi Offering Mooncakes to the Moon and Chang'e</h3><br><br>

                    Hou Yi was heartbroken when he found out what had happened to Chang'e. <br><br>He shouted to the sky and
                    surprisingly discovered the moon was extremely bright that night and then, caught sight of a swaying figure
                    that looked exactly like Chang'e. <br><br>Seeing that, Hou Yi made an offering of fruits and cakes that Chang'e had enjoyed, to let her know that
                    he missed her. <br><br>Since then, during the Mid-Autumn Festival, people have offered fruits
                    and mooncakes to worship the moon.<br>
