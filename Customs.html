                                <br>Moon worship used to be an important activity to celebrate the festival. 
                                <br><br>Usually after dinner, every family would put a table outside the door or in the courtyard to worship the moon and pray for blessings.
                                Offerings are made to a well-known lunar deity, Chang'e, known as 'Moon Goddess of Immortality'.
